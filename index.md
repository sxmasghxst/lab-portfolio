### CPSC 120

* Lab 7

    Lab 7, part 2 was one of my favorite labs because while I already knew how the  game worked, I learned how to translate it into code. This lab helped me understand how different coding is from the regular english language. It also helped me build mmy skills with translating one into the other.

* Lab 3
    
    Lab 3, part 2 was another of my favorite labs because I found the whole julian day thing really interesting. I thought it was cool that the algorithm behind it was so complex. I learned from this lab that there is an algorithm for calculating a date as a single number.

* Lab 6

    Lab 6, part 1 was the last of my favorite labs because it has Mad Libs! This lab as a whole was pretty nostalgic for me which was nice. It also taught me a bit about initializing the arguments vector.
